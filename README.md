# ScalaBridge London: Pipeline project

This is a case study of streaming data processing system motivated by the ScalaBridge London's `Streaming` project. 

For more detailed explanation of the idea behind this project, please read this [document]<https://github.com/scalabridgelondon/lesson-plans/blob/master/case-study/Streams.md>

`Pipeline` defined in this project is just a different name for `Stream` defined in the document.

The codes are written jointly together by a number of ScalaBridge London's participants who joined the discussion every fortnight.

### Getting Started:
1. Open a terminal and clone this repository
   ```sh
   $ git clone https://github.com/KXA194/Pipeline.git
   ```
2. Compile the project with [SBT](https://www.scala-sbt.org/)
   ```sh
   $ cd pipeline
   [pipeline]$ sbt
   sbt:pipeline> compile
   ```
   This should only take a few seconds.
